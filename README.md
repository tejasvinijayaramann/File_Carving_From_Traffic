# File Carving from Network Traffic

Recovered a PNG image from raw network traffic using **Wireshark**, **HxD**, and a simulated file transfer over **localhost**. This project demonstrates core digital forensic skills including packet capture, TCP stream analysis, and hex-level file reconstruction.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Wireshark** â€“ for capturing and analyzing network packets
- **HxD** â€“ for hex-level file carving
- **Python HTTP Server** â€“ to simulate image transfer
- **GitHub** â€“ for version control and documentation

---

## Project Workflow

###Simulate File Transfer
Started a Python HTTP server to host `test_image.png` locally:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000



###Capture Traffic in Wireshark

Selected the Loopback Adapter and accessed:
http://localhost:8000/test_image.png


###Filter and Locate the Image Request
Used Wireshark filter:
http.request.uri contains "test_image.png"


ðŸ“¸ HTTP GET Request

###Follow TCP Stream
Right-clicked the image request â†’ Follow â†’ TCP Stream â†’ Switched to Hex Dump view.
 TCP Stream Hex View

###Export Packet Bytes
Used File â†’ Export Packet Bytes to save the raw image data.
ðŸ“¸ Export Packet Bytes

###Recover the Image
Saved the exported bytes as recovered_image.png and verified the file opened successfully.
